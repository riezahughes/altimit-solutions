## Altimit OS

A simple passion project which was my first foray into Nodejs and express. Not the most elegant but it looks REALLY nice

Available online at https://altimit.solutions (Run on free heroku account, may take time to spin up) 

## Run Locally

```npm install``` and ```npm start``` as expected of an expess app.

The passion project ends at the "logging in" screen.
